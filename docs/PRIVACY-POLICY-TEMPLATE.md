# Privacy Policy

**Last updated:** [DATE]

## Analytics

This website uses Happening, a privacy-focused analytics tool, to understand how visitors use our site.

### What we collect

- Pages visited and referrer URLs
- Device type (desktop, mobile, tablet)
- Browser and operating system
- Country (derived from IP address)
- Viewport size

### What we do NOT collect

- Cookies or persistent identifiers
- Personal information (name, email, etc.)
- IP addresses (hashed and discarded)
- Cross-site tracking data

### How it works

Each visit generates an anonymous session identifier that cannot be used to identify you personally. This identifier is derived from your IP address and browser information using a one-way hash, then your IP address is discarded. We cannot reverse this process to recover your IP address.

### Data retention

Analytics data is stored on our self-hosted server located in [COUNTRY/REGION]. We retain aggregated analytics data for [TIME PERIOD, e.g., "12 months"].

### Your rights

Since we don't collect personal information, there is no personal data to access, correct, or delete. Our analytics are fully anonymous.

## Notes for site owners

1. **Customize the bracketed sections** with your specific details.

2. **Data retention**: Decide how long you'll keep data and document it.

3. **Server location**: If relevant to your users (especially EU visitors), mention where data is stored.

4. **Additional sections**: You may need to add sections for:
   - Other data you collect (contact forms, accounts, etc.)
   - Third-party services you use
   - Cookie policy (if you use cookies elsewhere on your site)

5. **Legal review**: This template is a starting point. Consider having a lawyer review your final policy, especially for commercial sites.

6. **GDPR note**: Happening's anonymous analytics generally don't require consent under GDPR since no personal data is processed. However, you should still disclose that you use analytics in your privacy policy.
